Problem 1: TRUE/FALSE
1. FALSE: Stochastic models will not always produce the same output x given the same input parameters 0. Rather unlike deterministic models, where outcomes are fully determined by the input parameters and inital conditions, stochastic models produce a range of possible outcomes, each with a certain probability.

2. FALSE: Replicability refers to obtaining consistent results by conducting a new study with different data under similar conditions. While reporducibility refers to obtaining consisten result susin the same data nd analysis methods.

3. TRUE

4. FALSE: IT can not only squash multiple commits into one. It also takes the commits from one branch and apply them on top of another branch.

5. TRUE: A detach head typically means that your HEAD pointer is not point to a specific branch, but a specific commit. This is usually the case when you are trying to find specific commits of your work.

6. TRUE

7. FALSE: It check identity. It determine if the objects are the same not if they are equal.

8. TRUE

Problem 2: Inverse vs. Forward Problems
1.A forward problem is a situation where you know the input parameters and you want to compute the output. In contrast an inverse problem is reversing the process. It is where you are given the output and you need to determine the input.

- Forward problem 1: You have calculate the spread rate of covid, know approximately how many are infected and can put those values into a computer to determine the total infected after a certain period of time.
- Forward problem 2: You are analyzing the prey and predator ratio. You know the birth rate of the prey and you know how many prey a predator consumes. You are then able to predict the predator prey ratio in the future.
- Forward problem 3: You know that rate of emissions per new vehicle and the rate of which new vehicles are purchased and old vehicles junked. This allows you to predict future emissions released into the atmosphere.
- Reverse problem 1:
