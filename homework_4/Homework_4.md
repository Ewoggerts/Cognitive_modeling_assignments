## Problem 1: True - False Questions (5 points)

1. **True.** K - fold cross - validation data is broken into K total subsets and used once as the test set. Then the subsets (folds) data is used for training that create K separate model fittings. We can then average the results from all K runs and get the final result.

2. **True.** bayes factors allow you to compare two different hypotheses by using Bayesian statistics. You compare the likelihood of one possibility over the liklihood of another possibility. However, this is a relative measure. It cannot determine if a model is valid or equally poor.

3. **False.** Marginal likelihoods and bayes factors are used for comparing models with different likelihoods. Marginal likelihoods inegrate out parameters. It is the likelihood averaged over the prior. You sum overal lthe possible values of the parameters, weighted by how plausible they were.

4. **False.** On the Binomial distribution is formulated as special case, however the Dirichlet distribution is not a special case of the Multinomial distribution.

5. **True.** Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) relies on
